# Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Eval ML (Auto ML)

## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the risk of heart attacks using various machine learning algorithms and evaluating the use of AutoML techniques, specifically EvalML, to simplify and optimize the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process.

## Introduction

Heart attacks are a critical health concern, and predicting the risk of a heart attack can be crucial for early intervention and prevention. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to create predictive models for heart attack risk. Additionally, it investigates the use of AutoML techniques with EvalML to streamline the model development process.

## Project Details

- **Data**: We use a dataset containing various medical attributes and historical data related to heart attack patients.(heart.csv)

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: We apply a range of machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, etc., to build predictive models.

- **AutoML with EvalML**: We explore the benefits of using EvalML, an AutoML library, to automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation processes, making it easier to find the best-performing model.
